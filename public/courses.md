# SINA TSC Command

## Michael Cucchiarella Memorial Boatswain School

Boatswains train, direct, and supervise personnel in ship's maintenance duties in all activities. They handle the disciplinary problems pertaining to enlisted personnel. They serve in or take charge of damage control parties. Boatswains also operate and maintain equipment used in loading and unloading cargo, ammunition, fuel, and general stores. Boatswains take charge of and supervise UNREP (underway replenishment) procedures and equipment. Boatswain’s Mates (or Bosuns) are the senior enlisted personnel aboard a ship. Within TRMN the position of Boatswain's Mate is a billet, not a rating, so the only Boatswain’s Mate aboard ship is the Bosun.

In remembrance and recognition of Master Chief Warrant Officer Michael Cucchiarella’s outstanding service and dedication to the Saganami Island Technical Specialties College, the Saganami Island Naval Academy, the Bureau of Training, and TRMN as a whole, the Boatswain School of the Command Department of the Technical Specialties College of the Saganami Island Naval Academy was renamed the Michael Cucchiarella Memorial Boatswain School. May we all remember MCWO Cucchiarella’s service and seek to emulate him.

## Master at Arms School

While not an official TRMN rating but a specialty job assignment, the Master-at-Arms (MAA) on a navy ship is concerned with law enforcement, antipiracy/fleet protection (AP/FP) and naval expeditionary warfare. They serve Fleet duty as a military police force onboard RMN ships under the control of the First Space Lord, on orbital forts under Fortress Command, as well as on space stations under Perimeter Security Command, on deep space fortifications, and in planet-side naval installations. Since MAs traditionally report directly to the CO of the command, they fall outside of the normal Chain of Command structure. In general, they are responsible for maintaining good order and discipline, enforcing rules and regulations, and protecting life and property.

# Space Warfare Pin

RMN

The Space Warfare Pin comes in two varieties: a gold one, for officers, and a silver one for enlisted personnel.

### Officers

Both RMN and RMMC officers wear the same pin. Although enlisted personnel may complete the academic qualifications for this pin, they may not wear it.

Officers of the RMN who have been awarded the OSWP and who subsequently transfer to the RMMC may continue to wear the OSWP until such time as they achieve the RMMC OSWP qualifications, and vice-versa.

### Enlisted

|     |
| :-- |

Both RMN and RMMC enlisted wear the same pin. Officers may wear the ESWP only provided it was earned and awarded while they were enlisted, and only until they have completed the requirements for the OSWP.

The ESWP is worn plain when first awarded. On being transferred to another unit, a numeral 2 is affixed to the centre of the pin, indicating a second deployment. A third deployment is indicated by a numeral 3; 4 and more deployments display a numeral 4.

Enlisted of the RMN who have been awarded the ESWP and who subsequently transfer to the RMMC may continue to wear the ESWP until such time as they achieve the RMMC ESWP qualifications, and vice-versa.

## Propulsion Group

### Robert Gartner Memorial Impeller School

Impeller Technicians operate, maintain, and repair ship’s propulsion systems. This includes manning the ship’s impeller rooms and care for hyper drive generators and Alpha and Beta impeller nodes.

Commander Robert Lea Gartner was one of TRMN’s early members and served for over five years until his passing on January 3, 2017\. He was well-loved by his chapter and TRMN, never hesitating to help out or support someone. Commander Gartner never let his illness interfere with his dedication to TRMN or the TSC, even asking to continue serving as the Impeller Instructor at the Naval Technical Specialties College on Saganami Island right up until his passing. In remembrance of Commander Gartner’s long-standing career and outstanding service and dedication to TRMN, the Naval TSC Impeller School on Saganami Island was renamed the Robert Gartner Memorial Impeller School on January 20, 2017, in BuTrain Order 006-17. May we all remember Commander Gartner’s service and seek to emulate him.

## Surgeon Officer School

The Ship’s Surgeon oversees all the medical facilities and personnel aboard ship, thus the position requires management and leadership skills. The Surgeon has a strong understanding of examination methodologies and diagnostics, excellent knowledge of infectious diseases, their symptoms and epidemiology, and broad knowledge of common medications, side effects and contraindications. On a ship during battle, the Surgeon attends to critical, massive, and complicated wounds. At the highest level and rank, they may be assigned to major military hospitals to administer and oversee the care of patients transferred from ships. Within TRMN the Assistant Surgeon is a Warrant Officer position and would work as an assistant medical officer aboard ship.

The SIA TSC Surgeon symbol is the Staff of Aesculapius, who was the god of medicine. Current views are that it is a more appropriate symbol than the Caduceus, which is associated with Hermes or Mercury, who was the messenger of the gods and the god of the underworld, commerce, merchants, thieves, and tricksters.

Passing SIA-SRN-34D will be a requirement for those wanting to be recognized as a Surgeon Officer within their chapter. Passing SIA-SRN-34W will be a requirement for those wanting to be recognized as a Surgeon Assistant within their chapter.
