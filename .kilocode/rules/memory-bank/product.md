## Why This Project Exists

The TRMN Course Tracker is a specialized educational progress management tool designed specifically for members of The Royal Manticoran Navy (TRMN), an international fan organization based on the Honor Harrington science fiction series. The application addresses the complex challenge of tracking progress through TRMN's extensive course system, which includes over 200 courses across multiple departments and institutions.

## Problems It Solves

### Course System Complexity

- **Complex Prerequisites**: TRMN courses have intricate prerequisite chains that can span multiple departments and course levels
- **Multiple Course Series**: Different course prefixes (SIA-RMN, SIA-SRN, RMACA, MU, LU, GPU-ALC) with varying formats
- **Department Dependencies**: Courses often require completion across multiple departments (Astrogation, Tactical, Engineering, etc.)
- **Special Qualifications**: Complex rules for Space Warfare Pins (OSWP/ESWP) requiring specific course combinations

### Progress Tracking Challenges

- **Manual Tracking Difficulty**: Members previously had to manually track course completion across multiple systems
- **Prerequisite Visibility**: Hard to determine which courses become available after completing others
- **Progress Persistence**: No centralized way to save and sync progress across devices
- **Reminder System**: No automated way to remind instructors about pending grades

### User Experience Issues

- **Course Discovery**: Difficult to find relevant courses within the large catalog
- **Progress Visualization**: No visual representation of course dependencies and progress
- **Multi-language Support**: Need for both English and Czech interfaces
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Responsive design required for mobile course tracking

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey

1. **Course Discovery**: Users can browse all available TRMN courses organized by department and skill tree
2. **Progress Tracking**: Mark courses as completed, in-progress, or waiting for grades
3. **Eligibility Engine**: System automatically determines which courses become available based on prerequisites
4. **Visual Progress**: Interactive skill tree shows course relationships and unlocks
5. **Settings Management**: Customize view preferences and language settings

### Key Features

- **Interactive Skill Tree**: Visual course dependency graph with unlock progression
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by department, level, completion status, or search terms
- **Progress Persistence**: Auto-save to localStorage with import/export capabilities
- **Multi-language Support**: English and Czech language options
- **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy-first analytics with user consent management
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Build-time Processing**: Markdown course data is parsed into JSON during build process
2. **Runtime Loading**: Pre-parsed JSON loads instantly (no runtime markdown processing)
3. **Eligibility Calculation**: Real-time prerequisite checking using dependency engine
4. **Progress Tracking**: Immediate UI updates with localStorage persistence
5. **Visual Updates**: Dynamic skill tree rendering based on completion status

## User Experience Goals

### Accessibility

- **WCAG Compliance**: Meet accessibility standards with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Skip Links**: Quick navigation to main content areas
- **Screen Reader Support**: Comprehensive screen reader compatibility
- **Color Contrast**: High contrast ratios for all text and interface elements

### Performance

- **Fast Loading**: Sub-2-second initial load time
- **Smooth Interactions**: 60fps animations and transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes from mobile to desktop
- **Offline Capability**: Core functionality works without internet connection

### Usability

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear information hierarchy and navigation patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show relevant information at appropriate times
- **Error Prevention**: Clear validation and helpful error messages
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate response to user actions

### Engagement

- **Gamification Elements**: Achievement system and progress visualization
- **Clear Progress Indicators**: Visual representation of completion status
- **Achievement System**: Unlock achievements for course milestones
- **Department Statistics**: Track progress across different skill areas
