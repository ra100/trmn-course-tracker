Project is a react application that helps tracking the progress of TRMN Courses.
Source of courses is markdown export of TRMN Course wiki. Goal is to provide a
simple tool to anyone who does TRMN Courses, needs to see which are available,
what are dependencies between courses and what's their progress. Also if they
need to send reminders to lectors.
