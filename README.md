## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment (GitHub Actions)

The project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. Every push to the `main` branch will:

1. Run all tests
2. Build the production version
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### GitHub Pages Setup

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:

   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"

2. **Required Permissions**:
   The GitHub Actions workflow needs these permissions (already configured):

   - `contents: read`
   - `pages: write`
   - `id-token: write`

3. **Branch Protection** (Optional):
   - Protect your main branch
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Include the "test" job from the workflow

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Styled Components** - CSS-in-JS styling
- **Vitest** - Testing framework
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing utilities

### Key Components

- **CourseParser** - Parses markdown course data
- **EligibilityEngine** - Determines course availability
- **SkillTreeView** - Main course display component
- **SettingsPanel** - User preferences management
